Global emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel burning jumped by the largest amount on record last year, 
upending the notion that the brief decline during the recession might persist through the recovery. 
Emissions rose 5.9 percent in 2010, according to an analysis released Sunday by the Global Carbon Project, 
an international collaboration of scientists tracking the numbers. Scientists with the group said the increase, 
a half-billion extra tons of carbon pumped into the air, was almost certainly the largest absolute jump in any 
year since the Industrial Revolution, and the largest percentage increase since 2003.
The increase solidified a trend of ever-rising emissions that scientists fear will make it difficult, 
if not impossible, to forestall severe climate change in coming decades.
The researchers said the high growth rate has been reflected in a bounce-back from the 1.4 percent drop in 
emissions in 2009, the year the recession had its biggest impact.
They do not expect the extraordinary growth to persist, but they do expect the emissions to return to 
something closer to the 3 percent yearly growth of the last decade, still a worrisome figure that 
signifies little progress in limiting the effects of greenhouse gases. The growth rate in the 1990s was closer to 1 percent yearly.
